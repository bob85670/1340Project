In this game, Player 1 and Player 2 are battling to get the points as fast as possible. Let’s say the input number for win is 100: The faster the player who gets 100 points, who is the winner. And in the game, there are 3 (or 4, if time allows) mini games which can be chosen by Player 1 and 2 respectively. That means it Player 1 choose the first game, Player 2 will choose the second game. The points get will accumulate and save for reference. The games can be played in unlimited trials, as long as both Player 1 and 2 haven’t reached 100 points. Below is the 3 suggested mini games:
	Tic-tac-toe
	Guess a number
	Master-mind
